# Pothole Reporting Form

This is a simple, interactive HTML and JavaScript form designed to collect pothole reports from the public or internal users. The form allows users to enter basic contact information, describe the pothole location, rate the severity, and provide additional details. Submitted reports are summarized dynamically on the page using JavaScript.

This project is ideal for local governments, DOTs, or community-driven reporting tools. It can be expanded with backend integration, location mapping, or data persistence.
